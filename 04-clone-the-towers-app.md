# Clone the Towers App

Clone the _towers_ app from [here](https://github.com/petermunro/towers), run `npm install`, then `npm start`.

Checkout the __start__ branch:

        git checkout start

The _towers_ app displays a tower with two buttons: _Add_ and _Delete_, which add and delete cells respectively.

Its purpose is as a teaching aid in learning Redux. :-)

1. View the action types (`src/redux/actionTypes.js`)

1. This app doesn't (yet) use `react-redux`. How is the view updated?

1. How are the actions dispatched?

1. What's stored in the state?
